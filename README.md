# v-debounce
**Update:** Thanks for all the downloads and hope v-debounce is useful in your project(s)! An update to v-debounce is comingâ„¢

Debounce directive for Vue2 to debounce input typing. Forked originally from https://github.com/vuejs-tips/v-debounce
Updated to include support for IE.

## Install
Install the NPM package:
```
yarn add v-debounce

# or if you prefer to use npm

npm install --save v-debounce
```

And then register the directive in your Vue inscance. You might do that globally using `Vue.use` or by importing the directive directly in your component.

```js
/* --- Install the directive globally --- */
import Vue from 'Vue'
import debounce from 'v-debounce'

Vue.use(debounce)

/* --- Import the directive directly in the component --- */
// In single file component

import { directive } from 'v-debounce'

export default {
  directives: { debounce: directive }
}
```

## Usage

**Template:**

Add an input in your template that uses the directive. For example a search field like this:

```
<input v-model.lazy="term" v-debounce="delay" placeholder="Search for something" />
```

In your script section, customize delay and keep track of when term changes, which in this case is 1 second after input has stopped.

**Script:**

```html
<template>
  <input v-model.lazy="term" v-debounce="delay" placeholder="Search for something" />
</template>

<script>
import { directive } from 'v-debounce'

export default {
  name: 'example',
  data () {
    return {
      delay: 1000,
      term: '',
    }
  },
  watch: {
    term () {
      // Do something with search term after it debounced
      console.log(`Search term changed to ${this.term}`)
    }
  },
  directives: {
    debounce: directive
  }
}
</script>
```
